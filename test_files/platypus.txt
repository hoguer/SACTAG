THE PLATYPUS (ORNITHORHYNCHUS ANATINUS) IS A SEMI-AQUATIC MAMMAL ENDEMIC TO EASTERN AUSTRALIA , INCLUDING TASMANIA . TOGETHER WITH THE FOUR SPECIES OF ECHIDNA , IT IS ONE OF THE FIE EXTANT SPECIES OF MONOTREMES , THE ONLY MAMMALS THAT LAY EGGS INSTEAD OF GIING BIRTH TO LIE YOUNG . IT IS THE SOLE LIING REPRESENTATIE OF ITS FAMILY (ORNITHORHYNCHIDAE) AND GENUS (ORNITHORHYNCHUS) , THOUGH A NUMBER OFRELATED SPECIES HAE BEEN FOUND IN THE FOSSIL RECORD . THE BIZARRE APPEARANCE OF THIS EGG-LAYING , ENOMOUS , DUCK-BILLED , BEAER-TAILED , OTTER-FOOTED MAMMAL BAFFLED EUROPEAN NATURALISTS WHEN THEY FIRST ENCOUNTERED IT , WITH SOME CONSIDERING IT AN ELABORATE FRAUD . IT IS ONE OF THE FEW ENOMOUS MAMMALS , THE MALE PLATYPUS HAING A SPUR ON THE HIND FOOT THAT DELIERS A ENOM CAPABLE OF CAUSING SEERE PAIN TO HUMANS . THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PLATYPUS MAKE IT AN IMPORTANT SUBECT IN THE STUDY OF EOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND A RECOGNISABLE AND ICONIC SYMBOL OF AUSTRALIA ; IT HAS APPEARED AS A MASCOT AT NATIONAL EENTS AND IS FEATURED ON THE REERSE OF THE AUSTRALIAN CENT COIN . THE PLATYPUS IS THE ANIMAL EMBLEM OF THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES . UNTIL THE EARLY TH CENTURY IT WAS HUNTED FOR ITS FUR , BUT IT IS NOW PROTECTED THROUGHOUT ITS RANGE . ALTHOUGH CAPTIE BREEDING PROGRAMMES HAE HAD ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS AND THE PLATYPUS IS ULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF POLLUTION , IT IS NOT UNDER ANY IMMEDIATE THREAT .

HEALESILLE CULTURAL REFERENCES SEE ALSO NOTES REFERENCES EXTERNAL LINKS TAXONOMY AND ETYMOLOGY WHEN THE PLATYPUS WAS FIRST ENCOUNTERED BY EUROPEANS IN , A PELT AND SKETCH WERE SENT BACK TO GREAT BRITAIN BY CAPTAIN OHN HUNTER , THE SECOND GOERNOR OF NEW SOUTH WALES . BRITISH SCIENTISTS INITIAL HUNCH WAS THAT THE ATTRIBUTES WERE A HOAX . GEORGE SHAW , WHO PRODUCED THE FIRST DESCRIPTION OF THE ANIMAL IN THE NATURALISTS MISCELLANY IN , STATED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS AS TO ITS GENUINE NATURE , AND ROBERT KNOX BELIEED IT MIGHT HAE BEEN PRODUCED BY SOME ASIAN TAXIDERMIST . IT WAS THOUGHT THAT SOMEBODY HAD SEWN A DUCKS BEAK ONTO THE BODY OF A BEAER-LIKE ANIMAL . SHAW EEN TOOK A PAIR OF SCISSORS TO THE DRIED SKIN TO CHECK FOR STITCHES . THE COMMON NAME PLATYPUS IS THE LATINISATION OF THE GREEK WORD (PLATUPOUS) , FLAT-FOOTED , FROM (PLATUS) , BROAD , WIDE , FLAT AND (POUS) , FOOT . SHAW ASSIGNED IT AS A LINNAEAN GENUS NAME WHEN HE INITIALLY DESCRIBED IT , BUT THE TERM WAS QUICKLY DISCOERED TO BELONG ALREADY TO THE WOOD-BORING AMBROSIA BEETLE (GENUS PLATYPUS) . IT WAS INDEPENDENTLY DESCRIBED AS ORNITHORHYNCHUS PARADOXUS BY OHANN BLUMENBACH IN (FROM A SPECIMEN GIEN TO HIM BYSIR OSEPH BANKS) AND FOLLOWING THE RULES OF PRIORITY OF NOMENCLATURE IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED AS ORNITHORHYNCHUS ANATINUS . THE SCIENTIFIC NAME ORNITHORHYNCHUS ANATINUS IS DERIED FROM (ORNITHORHYNKHOS) , WHICH LITERALLY MEANS BIRD SNOUT IN GREEK , AND ANATINUS , WHICH MEANS DUCK-LIKE IN LATIN . THERE IS NO UNIERSALLY AGREED PLURAL OF PLATYPUS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE . SCIENTISTS GENERALLY USE PLATYPUSES OR SIMPLY PLATYPUS . COLLOQUIALLY THE TERM PLATYPI IS ALSO USED FOR THE PLURAL , ALTHOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY INCORRECT AND A FORM OF PSEUDO-LATIN ; THE CORRECT GREEK PLURAL WOULD BE PLATYPODES . EARLY BRITISH SETTLERS CALLED IT BY MANY NAMES , SUCH ASWATERMOLE , DUCKBILL , AND DUCKMOLE . THE NAME PLATYPUS IS OFTEN PREFIXED WITH THE ADECTIE DUCK-BILLED TO FORM DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS , DESPITE THERE BEING ONLY ONE SPECIES OF PLATYPUS . DESCRIPTION THE BODY AND THE BROAD , FLAT TAIL OF THE PLATYPUS ARE COERED WITH DENSE BROWN FUR THAT TRAPS A LAYER OF INSULATING AIR TO KEEP THE ANIMAL WARM . THE FUR IS WATERPROOF , AND THE TEXTURE IS AKIN TO THAT OF A MOLE . THE PLATYPUS USES ITS TAIL FOR STORAGE OF FAT RESERES (AN ADAPTATION ALSO FOUND IN ANIMALS SUCH AS THE TASMANIAN DEIL AND FAT-TAILED SHEEP) . IT HAS WEBBED FEET AND A LARGE , RUBBERY SNOUT ; THESE ARE FEATURES THAT APPEAR CLOSER TO THOSE OF A DUCK THAN TO THOSE OF ANY KNOWN MAMMAL . THE WEBBING IS MORE SIGNIFICANT ON THE FRONT FEET AND IS FOLDED BACK WHEN WALKING ON LAND . UNLIKE A BIRDS BEAK (IN WHICH THE UPPER AND LOWER PARTS SEPARATE TO REEAL THE MOUTH) , THE SNOUT OF THE PLATYPUS IS A SENSORY ORGAN WITH THE MOUTH ON THE UNDERSIDE . THE NOSTRILS ARE LOCATED ON THE DORSAL SURFACE OF THE SNOUT , WHILE THE EYES AND EARS ARE LOCATED IN A GROOE SET UST BACK FROM IT ; THIS GROOE IS CLOSED WHEN SWIMMING . PLATYPUSES HAE BEEN HEARD TO EMIT A LOW GROWL WHEN DISTURBED AND A RANGE OF OTHER OCALISATIONS HAE BEEN REPORTED IN CAPTIE SPECIMENS . A COLOUR PRINT OF PLATYPUSES FROM WEIGHT ARIES CONSIDERABLY FROM . TO . KG ( . TO . LB) , WITH MALES BEING LARGER THAN FEMALES : MALES AERAGE CM ( IN) IN TOTAL LENGTH WHILE FEMALES AERAGE CM ( IN) . THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL ARIATION IN AERAGE SIZE FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER , AND THIS PATTERN DOES NOT SEEM TO FOLLOW ANY PARTICULAR CLIMATIC RULE AND MAY BE DUE TO OTHER ENIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS PREDATION AND HUMAN ENCROACHMENT . THE PLATYPUS HAS AN AERAGE BODY TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT C ( F) RATHER THAN THE C ( F) TYPICAL OF PLACENTAL MAMMALS . RESEARCH SUGGESTS THIS HAS BEEN A GRADUAL ADAPTATION TO HARSH ENIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THE PART OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF SURIING MONOTREME SPECIES RATHER THAN A HISTORICAL CHARACTERISTIC OF MONOTREMES . MODERN PLATYPUS YOUNG HAE THREE-CUSPED MOLARS , WHICH THEY LOSE BEFORE OR UST AFTER LEAING THE BREEDING BURROW ; ADULTS HAE HEAILY KERATINISED PADS IN THEIR PLACE . THE PLATYPUS AW IS CONSTRUCTED DIFFERENTLY FROM THAT OF OTHER MAMMALS , AND THE AW-OPENING MUSCLE IS DIFFERENT . AS IN ALL TRUE MAMMALS , THE TINY BONES THAT CONDUCT SOUND IN THE MIDDLE EAR ARE FULLY INCORPORATED INTO THE SKULL , RATHER THAN LYING IN THE AW AS IN CYNODONTS AND OTHER PRE-MAMMALIAN SYNAPSIDS . HOWEER , THE EXTERNAL OPENING OF THE EAR STILL LIES AT THE BASE OF THE AW . THE PLATYPUS HAS EXTRA BONES IN THE SHOULDER GIRDLE , INCLUDING AN INTERCLAICLE , WHICH IS NOT FOUND IN OTHER MAMMALS . IT HAS A REPTILIAN GAIT , WITH LEGS THAT ARE ON THE SIDES OF THE BODY , RATHER THAN UNDERNEATH . WHEN ON LAND IT ENGAGES IN KNUCKLE-WALKING TO PROTECT THE WEBBING BETWEEN ITS TOES . ENOM MAIN ARTICLE : PLATYPUS ENOM THE CALCANEUS SPUR FOUND ON THE MALES HIND LIMB IS USED TO DELIER ENOM . WHILE BOTH MALE AND FEMALE PLATYPUSES ARE BORN WITH ANKLE SPURS , ONLY THE MALE HAS SPURS WHICH PRODUCE A COCKTAIL OF ENOM , COMPOSED LARGELY OF DEFENSIN-LIKE PROTEINS (DLPS) , THREE OF WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO THE PLATYPUS . THE DEFENSIN PROTEINS ARE PRODUCED BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THE PLATYPUS . ALTHOUGH POWERFUL ENOUGH TO KILL SMALLER ANIMALS SUCH AS DOGS , THE ENOM IS NOT LETHAL TO HUMANS , BUT IS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT THE ICTIM MAY BE INCAPACITATED . OEDEMA RAPIDLY DEELOPS AROUND THE WOUND AND GRADUALLY SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE AFFECTED LIMB . INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM CASE HISTORIES AND ANECDOTAL EIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE PAIN DEELOPS INTO A LONG-LASTINGHYPERALGESIA (A HEIGHTENED SENSITIITY TO PAIN) THAT PERSISTS FOR DAYS OR EEN MONTHS . ENOM IS PRODUCED IN THE CRURAL GLANDS OF THE MALE , WHICH ARE KIDNEY-SHAPED ALEOLAR GLANDS CONNECTED BY A THIN-WALLED DUCT TO A CALCANEUS SPUR ON EACH HIND LIMB . THE FEMALE PLATYPUS , IN COMMON WITH ECHIDNAS , HAS RUDIMENTARY SPUR BUDS WHICH DO NOT DEELOP (DROPPING OFF BEFORE THE END OF THEIR FIRST YEAR) AND LACK FUNCTIONAL CRURAL GLANDS . THE ENOM APPEARS TO HAE A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FROM THOSE PRODUCED BY NON-MAMMALIAN SPECIES : ITS EFFECTS ARE NOT LIFE-THREATENING TO HUMANS BUT NEERTHELESS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SERIOUSLY IMPAIR THE ICTIM . SINCE ONLY MALES PRODUCE ENOM AND PRODUCTION RISES DURING THE BREEDING SEASON , IT IS THEORISED THAT IT IS USED AS AN OFFENSIE WEAPON TO ASSERT DOMINANCE DURING THIS PERIOD . ELECTROLOCATION PLATYPUS (ORNITHORHYNCHUS ANATINUS) MONOTREMES (FOR THE OTHER SPECIES , SEE ECHIDNA) ARE THE ONLY MAMMALS KNOWN TO HAE A SENSE OF ELECTRORECEPTION : THEY LOCATE THEIR PREY IN PART BY DETECTING ELECTRIC FIELDS GENERATED BY MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS . THE PLATYPUS ELECTRORECEPTION IS THE MOST SENSITIE OF ANY MONOTREME . THE ELECTRORECEPTORS ARE LOCATED IN ROSTRO-CAUDAL ROWS IN THE SKIN OF THE BILL , WHILE MECHANORECEPTORS (WHICH DETECT TOUCH) ARE UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE BILL . THE ELECTROSENSORY AREA OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE TACTILE SOMATOSENSORY AREA , AND SOME CORTICAL CELLS RECEIE INPUT FROM BOTH ELECTRORECEPTORS AND MECHANORECEPTORS , SUGGESTING A CLOSE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE TACTILE AND ELECTRIC SENSES . BOTH ELECTRORECEPTORS AND MECHANORECEPTORS IN THE BILL DOMINATE THE SOMATOTOPIC MAP OF THE PLATYPUS BRAIN , IN THE SAME WAY HUMAN HANDS DOMINATE THE PENFIELD HOMUNCULUS MAP . THE PLATYPUS CAN DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF AN ELECTRIC SOURCE , PERHAPS BY COMPARING DIFFERENCES IN SIGNAL STRENGTH ACROSS THE SHEET OF ELECTRORECEPTORS . THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE CHARACTERISTIC SIDE-TO-SIDE MOTION OF THE ANIMALS HEAD WHILE HUNTING . THE CORTICAL CONERGENCE OF ELECTROSENSORY AND TACTILE INPUTS SUGGESTS A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING THE DISTANCE OF PREY ITEMS WHICH , WHEN THEY MOE , EMIT BOTH ELECTRICAL SIGNALS AND MECHANICAL PRESSURE PULSES : THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TIMES OF ARRIAL OF THE TWO SIGNALS WOULD ALLOW COMPUTATION OF DISTANCE . THE PLATYPUS FEEDS BY NEITHER SIGHT NOR SMELL , CLOSING ITS EYES , EARS , AND NOSE EACH TIME IT DIES . RATHER , WHEN IT DIGS IN THE BOTTOM OF STREAMS WITH ITS BILL , ITS ELECTRORECEPTORS DETECT TINY ELECTRICAL CURRENTS GENERATED BY MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS OF ITS PREY , SO ENABLING IT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ANIMATE AND INANIMATE OBECTS , WHICH CONTINUOUSLY STIMULATE ITS MECHANORECEPTORS . EXPERIMENTS HAE SHOWN THAT THE PLATYPUS WILL EEN REACT TO AN ARTIFICIAL SHRIMP IF A SMALL ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH IT . ECOLOGY AND BEHAIOUR DENTITION , AS ILLUSTRATED IN KNIGHTSSKETCHES IN NATURAL HISTORY THE PLATYPUS IS ERY DIFFICULT TO SPOT EEN ON THE SURFACE OF A RIER . PLATYPUS SWIMMING SWIMMING UNDERWATER AT SYDNEY AQUARIUM , AUSTRALIA THE PLATYPUS IS SEMI-AQUATIC , INHABITING SMALL STREAMS AND RIERS OER AN EXTENSIE RANGE FROM THE COLD HIGHLANDS OF TASMANIA AND THE AUSTRALIAN ALPS TO THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS OF COASTALQUEENSLAND AS FAR NORTH AS THE BASE OF THE CAPE YORK PENINSULA . INLAND , ITS DISTRIBUTION IS NOT WELL KNOWN : IT IS EXTINCT IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA (APART FROM AN INTRODUCED POPULATION ON KANGAROO ISLAND) AND IS NO LONGER FOUND IN THE MAIN PART OF THE MURRAYDARLING BASIN , POSSIBLY DUE TO THE DECLINING WATER QUALITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY EXTENSIE LAND CLEARING AND IRRIGATION SCHEMES . ALONG THE COASTAL RIER SYSTEMS , ITS DISTRIBUTION IS UNPREDICTABLE ; IT APPEARS TO BE ABSENT FROM SOME RELATIELY HEALTHY RIERS , AND YET MAINTAINS A PRESENCE IN OTHERS THAT ARE QUITE DEGRADED (THE LOWERMARIBYRNONG , FOR EXAMPLE) . IN CAPTIITY PLATYPUSES HAE SURIED TO SEENTEEN YEARS OF AGE , AND WILD SPECIMENS HAE BEEN RECAPTURED WHEN ELEEN YEARS OLD . MORTALITY RATES FOR ADULTS IN THE WILD APPEAR TO BE LOW . NATURAL PREDATORS INCLUDE SNAKES , WATER RATS , GOANNAS , HAWKS , OWLS , AND EAGLES . LOW PLATYPUS NUMBERS IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA ARE POSSIBLY DUE TO PREDATION BY CROCODILES . THE INTRODUCTION OFRED FOXES AS A PREDATOR FOR RABBITS MAY HAE HAD SOME IMPACT ON ITS NUMBERS ON THE MAINLAND . THE PLATYPUS IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS NOCTURNAL AND CREPUSCULAR , BUT INDIIDUALS ARE ALSO ACTIE DURING THE DAY , PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SKY IS OERCAST . ITS HABITAT BRIDGES RIERS AND THE RIPARIAN ZONE FOR BOTH A FOOD SUPPLY OF PREY SPECIES AND BANKS WHERE IT CAN DIG RESTING AND NESTING BURROWS . IT MAY HAE A RANGE OF UP TO KM ( . MI) , WITH A MALES HOME RANGE OERLAPPING THOSE OF OR FEMALES . THE PLATYPUS IS AN EXCELLENT SWIMMER AND SPENDS MUCH OF ITS TIME IN THE WATER FORAGING FOR FOOD . WHEN SWIMMING IT CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER AUSTRALIAN MAMMALS BY THE ABSENCE OF ISIBLE EARS . UNIQUELY AMONG MAMMALS IT PROPELS ITSELF WHEN SWIMMING BY AN ALTERNATE ROWING MOTION OF THE FRONT TWO FEET ; ALTHOUGH ALL FOUR FEET OF THE PLATYPUS ARE WEBBED , THE HIND FEET (WHICH ARE HELD AGAINST THE BODY) DO NOT ASSIST IN PROPULSION , BUT ARE USED FOR STEERING IN COMBINATION WITH THE TAIL . THE SPECIES IS ENDOTHERMIC , MAINTAINING ITS BODY TEMPERATURE AT ABOUT C ( F) , LOWER THAN MOST MAMMALS , EEN WHILE FORAGING FOR HOURS IN WATER BELOW C ( F) . DIES NORMALLY LAST AROUND SECONDS BUT CAN LAST LONGER , ALTHOUGH FEW EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AEROBIC LIMIT OF SECONDS . RECOERY AT THE SURFACE BETWEEN DIES COMMONLY TAKES FROM TO SECONDS . THE PLATYPUS IS A CARNIORE : IT FEEDS ON ANNELID WORMS AND INSECT LARAE , FRESHWATER SHRIMPS , AND YABBIES (FRESHWATER CRAYFISH) THAT IT DIGS OUT OF THE RIERBED WITH ITS SNOUT OR CATCHES WHILE SWIMMING . IT UTILISES CHEEK-POUCHES TO CARRY PREY TO THE SURFACE , WHERE THEY ARE EATEN . THE PLATYPUS NEEDS TO EAT ABOUT OF ITS OWN WEIGHT EACH DAY . THIS REQUIRES THE PLATYPUS TO SPEND AN AERAGE OF HOURS EACH DAY LOOKING FOR FOOD . WHEN NOT IN THE WATER , THE PLATYPUS RETIRES TO A SHORT , STRAIGHT RESTING BURROW OF OAL CROSS-SECTION , NEARLY ALWAYS IN THE RIERBANK NOT FAR ABOE WATER LEEL , AND OFTEN HIDDEN UNDER A PROTECTIE TANGLE OF ROOTS . REPRODUCTION WHEN THE PLATYPUS WAS FIRST ENCOUNTERED BY EUROPEAN NATURALISTS , THEY WERE DIIDED OER WHETHER THE FEMALE LAID EGGS . THIS WAS NOT CONFIRMED UNTIL WHEN W . H . CALDWELL WAS SENT TO AUSTRALIA WHERE , AFTER EXTENSIE SEARCHING ASSISTED BY A TEAM OF ABORIGINES , HE MANAGED TO DISCOER A FEW EGGS . MINDFUL OF THE HIGH COST PER WORD OF WIRING ENGLAND , CALDWELL FAMOUSLY BUT TERSELY WIRED LONDON , MONOTREMES OIPAROUS , OUM MEROBLASTIC . THAT IS , MONOTREMES LAY EGGS , AND THE EGGS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF REPTILES IN THAT ONLY PART OF THE EGG DIIDES AS IT DEELOPS . THE SPECIES EXHIBITS A SINGLE BREEDING SEASON ; MATING OCCURS BETWEEN UNE AND OCTOBER , WITH SOME LOCAL ARIATION TAKING PLACE BETWEEN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ACROSS ITS RANGE . HISTORICAL OBSERATION , MARK-AND-RECAPTURE STUDIES , AND PRELIMINARY INESTIGATIONS OF POPULATION GENETICS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF BOTH RESIDENT AND TRANSIENT MEMBERS OF POPULATIONS AND SUGGEST A POLYGYNOUS MATING SYSTEM . FEMALES ARE THOUGHT LIKELY TO BECOME SEXUALLY MATURE IN THEIR SECOND YEAR , WITH BREEDING CONFIRMED STILL TO TAKE PLACE IN ANIMALS OER NINE YEARS OLD . OUTSIDE THE MATING SEASON , THE PLATYPUS LIES IN A SIMPLE GROUND BURROW WHOSE ENTRANCE IS ABOUT CM ( IN) ABOE THE WATER LEEL . AFTER MATING , THE FEMALE CONSTRUCTS A DEEPER , MORE ELABORATE BURROW UP TO M ( FT) LONG AND BLOCKED AT INTERALS WITH PLUGS (WHICH MAY ACT AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST RISING WATERS OR PREDATORS , OR AS A METHOD OF REGULATING HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE) . THE MALE TAKES NO PART IN CARING FOR ITS YOUNG , AND RETREATS TO ITS YEAR-LONG BURROW . THE FEMALE SOFTENS THE GROUND IN THE BURROW WITH DEAD , FOLDED , WET LEAES AND SHE FILLS THE NEST AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WITH FALLEN LEAES AND REEDS FOR BEDDING MATERIAL . THIS MATERIAL IS DRAGGED TO THE NEST BY TUCKING IT UNDERNEATH HER CURLED TAIL . THE FEMALE PLATYPUS HAS A PAIR OF OARIES BUT ONLY THE LEFT ONE IS FUNCTIONAL . IT LAYS ONE TO THREE (USUALLY TWO) SMALL , LEATHERY EGGS (SIMILAR TO THOSE OF REPTILES) , THAT ARE ABOUT MM ( . IN) IN DIAMETER AND SLIGHTLY ROUNDER THAN BIRD EGGS . THE EGGS DEELOP IN UTERO FOR ABOUT DAYS WITH ONLY ABOUT DAYS OF EXTERNAL INCUBATION (IN CONTRAST TO A CHICKEN EGG , WHICH SPENDS ABOUT DAY IN TRACT AND DAYS EXTERNALLY) . AFTER LAYING HER EGGS , THE FEMALE CURLS AROUND THEM . THE INCUBATION PERIOD IS DIIDED INTO THREE PHASES . IN THE FIRST PHASE , THE EMBRYO HAS NO FUNCTIONAL ORGANS AND RELIES ON THE YOLK SAC FOR SUSTENANCE . THE YOLK IS ABSORBED BY THE DEELOPING YOUNG . DURING THE SECOND PHASE , THE DIGITS DEELOP AND , IN THE LAST PHASE , THE EGG TOOTH APPEARS . THE NEWLY HATCHED YOUNG ARE ULNERABLE , BLIND , AND HAIRLESS , AND ARE FED BY THE MOTHERS MILK . ALTHOUGH POSSESSING MAMMARY GLANDS , THE PLATYPUS LACKS TEATS . INSTEAD , MILK IS RELEASED THROUGH PORES IN THE SKIN . THERE ARE GROOES ON HER ABDOMEN IN WHICH THE MILK POOLS , ALLOWING THE YOUNG TO LAP IT UP . AFTER THEY HATCH , THE OFFSPRING ARE SUCKLED FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS . DURING INCUBATION AND WEANING , THE MOTHER INITIALLY LEAES THE BURROW ONLY FOR SHORT PERIODS , TO FORAGE . WHEN DOING SO , SHE CREATES A NUMBER OF THIN SOIL PLUGS ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE BURROW , POSSIBLY TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROM PREDATORS ; PUSHING PAST THESE ON HER RETURN FORCES WATER FROM HER FUR AND ALLOWS THE BURROW TO REMAIN DRY . AFTER ABOUT FIE WEEKS , THE MOTHER BEGINS TO SPEND MORE TIME AWAY FROM HER YOUNG AND , AT AROUND FOUR MONTHS , THE YOUNG EMERGE FROM THE BURROW . A PLATYPUS IS BORN WITH TEETH , BUT THESE DROP OUT AT A ERY EARLY AGE , LEAING THE HORNY PLATES WITH WHICH IT GRINDS ITS FOOD . SLEEP FURTHER INFORMATION : SLEEP (NON-HUMAN) THE AERAGE SLEEP TIME IN A -HOUR PERIOD OF A PLATYPUS IS SAID TO BE AS LONG AS HOURS . WHY MAYBE BECAUSE UST A LITTLE CRUSTACEAN MEAL PACKS A HUGE CALORIC PUNCH . EOLUTION PLATYPUS SKELETON THE PLATYPUS AND OTHER MONOTREMES WERE ERY POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND SOME OF THE TH CENTURY MYTHS THAT GREW UP AROUND THEMFOR EXAMPLE , THAT THE MONOTREMES WERE INFERIOR OR QUASI-REPTILIANSTILL ENDURE . IN , WILLIAM KING GREGORY THEORISED THAT PLACENTAL MAMMALS AND MARSUPIALS MAY HAE DIERGED EARLIER AND A SUBSEQUENT BRANCHING DIIDED THE MONOTREMES AND MARSUPIALS , BUT LATER RESEARCH AND FOSSIL DISCOERIES HAE SUGGESTED THIS IS INCORRECT . IN FACT , MODERN MONOTREMES ARE THE SURIORS OF AN EARLY BRANCHING OF THE MAMMAL TREE , AND A LATER BRANCHING IS THOUGHT TO HAE LED TO THE MARSUPIAL AND PLACENTAL GROUPS . MOLECULAR CLOCK AND FOSSIL DATING SUGGEST PLATYPUSES SPLIT FROM ECHIDNAS AROUND MILLION YEARS AGO . PLATYPUS ECHIDNAS LIE BIRTH MARSUPIALS TRUE PLACENTA EUTHERIANS EOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PLATYPUS AND OTHER MAMMALS . THE OLDEST DISCOERED FOSSIL OF THE MODERN PLATYPUS DATES BACK TO ABOUT , YEARS AGO , DURING THE QUATERNARY PERIOD . THE EXTINCT MONOTREMES TEINOLOPHOS AND STEROPODON WERE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MODERN PLATYPUS . THE FOSSILISED STEROPODON WAS DISCOERED IN NEW SOUTH WALES AND IS COMPOSED OF AN OPALISED LOWER AWBONE WITH THREE MOLAR TEETH (WHEREAS THE ADULT CONTEMPORARY PLATYPUS IS TOOTHLESS) . THE MOLAR TEETH WERE INITIALLY THOUGHT TO BE TRIBOSPHENIC , WHICH WOULD HAE SUPPORTED A ARIATION OF GREGORYS THEORY , BUT LATER RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT , WHILE THEY HAE THREE CUSPS , THEY EOLED UNDER A SEPARATE PROCESS . THE FOSSIL IS THOUGHT TO BE ABOUT MILLION YEARS OLD , WHICH MEANS THAT THE PLATYPUS-LIKE ANIMAL WAS ALIE DURING THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD , MAKING IT THE OLDEST MAMMAL FOSSIL FOUND IN AUSTRALIA . MONOTREMATUM SUDAMERICANUM , ANOTHER FOSSIL RELATIE OF THE PLATYPUS , HAS BEEN FOUND IN ARGENTINA , INDICATING THAT MONOTREMES WERE PRESENT IN THE SUPERCONTINENT OF GONDWANA WHEN THE CONTINENTS OF SOUTH AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA WERE OINED IA ANTARCTICA (UP TO ABOUT MILLION YEARS AGO) . BECAUSE OF THE EARLY DIERGENCE FROM THE THERIAN MAMMALS AND THE LOW NUMBERS OF EXTANT MONOTREME SPECIES , THE PLATYPUS IS A FREQUENT SUBECT OF RESEARCH IN EOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY . IN , RESEARCHERS AT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIERSITY DISCOERED THE PLATYPUS HAS TEN SEX CHROMOSOMES , COMPARED WITH TWO (XY) IN MOST OTHER MAMMALS (FOR INSTANCE , A MALE PLATYPUS IS ALWAYS XYXYXYXYXY) , ALTHOUGH , GIEN THE XY DESIGNATION OF MAMMALS , THE SEX CHROMOSOMES OF THE PLATYPUS ARE MORE SIMILAR TO THE ZZ/ZW SEX CHROMOSOMES FOUND IN BIRDS . THE PLATYPUS GENOME ALSO HAS BOTH REPTILIAN AND MAMMALIAN GENES ASSOCIATED WITH EGG FERTILISATION . SINCE THE PLATYPUS LACKS THE MAMMALIAN SEX-DETERMINING GENE SRY , THE MECHANISM OF SEX DETERMINATION REMAINS UNKNOWN . A DRAFT ERSION OF THE PLATYPUS GENOME SEQUENCE WAS PUBLISHED IN NATUREON MAY , REEALING BOTH REPTILIAN AND MAMMALIAN ELEMENTS , AS WELL AS TWO GENES FOUND PREIOUSLY ONLY IN BIRDS , AMPHIBIANS , AND FISH . MORE THAN OF THE PLATYPUS GENES ARE COMMON TO THE OTHER MAMMALS WHOSE GENOMES HAE BEEN SEQUENCED . CONSERATION STATUS A DEPICTION OF A PLATYPUS FROM A BOOK FOR CHILDREN PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IN EXCEPT FOR ITS LOSS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA , THE PLATYPUS OCCUPIES THE SAME GENERAL DISTRIBUTION AS IT DID PRIOR TO EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT OF AUSTRALIA . HOWEER , LOCAL CHANGES AND FRAGMENTATION OF DISTRIBUTION DUE TO HUMAN MODIFICATION OF ITS HABITAT ARE DOCUMENTED . ITS CURRENT AND HISTORICAL ABUNDANCE , HOWEER , ARE LESS WELL-KNOWN AND IT HAS PROBABLY DECLINED IN NUMBERS , ALTHOUGH STILL BEING CONSIDERED AS COMMON OER MOST OF ITS CURRENT RANGE . THE SPECIES WAS EXTENSIELY HUNTED FOR ITS FUR UNTIL THE EARLY YEARS OF THE TH CENTURY AND , ALTHOUGH PROTECTED THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA SINCE , UNTIL ABOUT IT WAS STILL AT RISK OF DROWNING IN THE NETS OF INLAND FISHERIES . THE PLATYPUS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER OF EXTINCTION THANKS TO CONSERATION MEASURES , BUT IT COULD BE IMPACTED BY HABITAT DISRUPTION CAUSED BY DAMS , IRRIGATION , POLLUTION , NETTING , AND TRAPPING . THE IUCN LISTS THE PLATYPUS ON ITS RED LIST AS LEAST CONCERN . PLATYPUSES GENERALLY SUFFER FROM FEW DISEASES IN THE WILD ; HOWEER , THERE IS WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CONCERN IN TASMANIA ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF A DISEASE CAUSED BY THE FUNGUS MUCOR AMPHIBIORUM . THE DISEASE (TERMED MUCORMYCOSIS) AFFECTS ONLY TASMANIAN PLATYPUSES AND HAS NOT BEEN OBSERED IN PLATYPUSES IN MAINLAND AUSTRALIA . AFFECTED PLATYPUSES CAN DEELOP UGLY SKIN LESIONS OR ULCERS ON ARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY , INCLUDING THEIR BACKS , TAILS , AND LEGS . MUCORMYCOSIS CAN KILL PLATYPUSES , DEATH ARISING FROM SECONDARY INFECTION AND BY AFFECTING THE ANIMALS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN BODY TEMPERATURE AND FORAGE EFFICIENCY . THE BIODIERSITY CONSERATION BRANCH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND WATER ARE COLLABORATING WITH NRM NORTH AND UNIERSITY OF TASMANIA RESEARCHERS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE DISEASE ON TASMANIAN PLATYPUSES , AS WELL AS THE MECHANISM OF TRANSMISSION AND CURRENT SPREAD OF THE DISEASE . UNTIL RECENTLY , THE INTRODUCED RED FOX (ULPES ULPES) WAS CONFINED TO MAINLAND AUSTRALIA , BUT GROWING EIDENCE NOW INDICATES THAT IT IS PRESENT IN LOW NUMBERS IN TASMANIA . MUCH OF THE WORLD WAS INTRODUCED TO THE PLATYPUS IN WHEN NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ON THE PLATYPUS AND THE EFFORTS TO STUDY AND RAISE IT IN CAPTIITY . THE LATTER IS A DIFFICULT TASK , AND ONLY A FEW YOUNG HAE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RAISED SINCENOTABLY ATHEALESILLE SANCTUARY IN ICTORIA . THE LEADING FIGURE IN THESE EFFORTS WAS DAID FLEAY , WHO ESTABLISHED A PLATYPUSARYA SIMULATED STREAM IN A TANKAT THE HEALESILLE SANCTUARY , WHERE BREEDING WAS SUCCESSFUL IN . IN , HE FOUND A DEAD BABY OF ABOUT DAYS OLD , WHICH HAD PRESUMABLY BEEN BORN IN CAPTIITY , AT HISWILDLIFE PARK AT BURLEIGH HEADS ON THE GOLD COAST , QUEENSLAND . HEALESILLE REPEATED ITS SUCCESS IN AND AGAIN IN WITH A SIMILAR STREAM TANK . TARONGA ZOO IN SYDNEY BRED TWINS IN , AND BREEDING WAS AGAIN SUCCESSFUL THERE IN .
